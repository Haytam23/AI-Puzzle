Heuristic,Average Effective Branching Factor (b*)
Misplaced Tiles (h1),1.0272
Manhattan Distance (h2),1.0046    /* Among the admissible heuristics Manhattan Distance is the most efficient because the effective branching factor is the closet to 1 */
Euclidean Distance (h3),1.0127
Out of Row and Column (h4),1.0060
